# My portfolio

Hi and welcome to my portfolio repo, I am Mohamed Ali, a frontend developer. I built my portfolio using ReactJS with TypeScript, where I included some of the coding challenges I solved along with my wedding planner and expenses tracker. 

I am currently looking for a new remote position as a software engineer. Feel free to contact me if you are interested.

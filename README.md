# My portfolio

Hi and welcome to my portfolio repo, I am Mohamed Ali, a frontend developer.

I built my portfolio using **ReactJS** with **TypeScript**, where I included some of the coding challenges I solved along with my Wedding Planner and Expenses Tracker [web appðŸ”—](https://dream-wed.onrender.com/). 


I am currently looking for a new remote position as a software engineer. Feel free to contact me if you are interested.
